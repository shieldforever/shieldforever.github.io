I received the B.S. degree from the College of Intelligence and Computing, Tianjin University in 2022. I am chasing my Ph.D. degree in CS. in Shanghai Jiao Tong University Advanced Computer Architecture Laboratory ([ACA Lab](https://acalab.sjtu.edu.cn/CN/)), under the supervision of Prof. [Li Jiang](https://cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~jiangli//) and Assist Prof. [Fangxin Liu](https://mxhx7199.github.io/).

My current research interests focus on **Hardware-software Co-Design for Efficient and Secure AI**.

Hardware: various computing platform, including (CIM-based) ASIC design, edge FPGAs, and edge/server-end GPUs.

Software: **Brain-inspired Neuromorphic Computing**, **LLMs/Neural Networks**, **3D Perception and Generation**, and **Secure AI Workloads**.

- **Brain-inspired Neuromorphic Computing**:
  - Effective Applications [ICCAD'23, SIGIR'22]
  - Adaptive and Flexible Compression [ISCA'25, ASP-DAC'25]
  - Execution Optimization [2√óDATE'25, TPDS'24, ASP-DAC'24]
  - CiM-based Accelration [MICRO'24, ASP-DAC'24]
- **LLMs/Neural Network Acceleration**
  - Acceleration of Neural Networks via Efficient Encoding [HPCA'24, DAC'24]
  - Sparsity Compilation [HPCA'25, TODAES'24, ASP-DAC'24]
- **Efficient 3D Perception and Generation**
  - Deformable Attention Optimization for Efficient 3D Detection [DAC'24]
  - 3D Reconstruction Acceleration
- **Efficient design for Secure AI**
  - Area Effcient Design for LUT-based Large Number Modular Reduction [DAC'25]
  - Secure Neuromorphic Computing [DAC'24, ASP-DAC'24, DAC'23]
