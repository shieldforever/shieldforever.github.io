I received the B.S. degree from eh College of Intelligence and Computing, Tianjin University in 2022. I am chasing my Ph.D. degree in CS. in Shanghai Jiao Tong University Advanced Computer Architecture Laboratory (ACA Lab), supervised by Prof. [Li Jiang](https://cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~jiangli//), focusing on the research of in-memory computing, hyperdimensional computing, software-hardware co-design, and neuromorphic computing. 

Research
-----------
Current research interests focuses on:

- In-memory Computing (存内计算)
- Brian-inspired Neuromorphic Computing (神经模态计算)
- Neural Network Acceleration
