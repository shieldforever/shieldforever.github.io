I received the B.S. degree from the College of Intelligence and Computing, Tianjin University in 2022. I am chasing my Ph.D. degree in CS. in [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/), Intelligent Memory & Processor Architecture & Computing Lab (IMPACT Lab), under the supervision of Prof. [Li Jiang](https://cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~jiangli//) and Assist Prof. [Fangxin Liu](https://mxhx7199.github.io/).

My current research interests focus on Hardware-software Co-Design for Efficient and Secure AI.<br>
Hardware: (CIM-based) ASIC Design, Edge FPGAs, and Edge/Server GPUs.<br>
Software: Brain-Inspired Neuromorphic Computing, LLMs/Neural Networks, 3D Perception and Generation, and Secure AI Workloads.
