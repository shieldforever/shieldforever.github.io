I am now chasing my Ph.D. degree in CS. in [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/), Intelligent Memory & Processor Architecture & Computing Lab (IMPACT Lab), under the supervision of Prof. [Li Jiang](https://cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~jiangli//) and Assist Prof. [Fangxin Liu](https://mxhx7199.github.io/).
I graduated from the College of Intelligence and Computing, Tianjin University with a bachelor's degree in 2022.

My current research interests focus on Hardware-software Co-Design for Efficient and Secure AI.<br>
Hardware: Domain Specific Architectures (DSAs), In-Memory Computing (CIM), Edge FPGAs, and Edge/Server GPUs.<br>
Software: Brain-Inspired Neuromorphic Computing, LLMs/Neural Networks, Spatial Intelligence (Efficient 3D Perception and Reconstruction), and Secure AI Workloads.
