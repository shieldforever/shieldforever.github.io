<br>
**Description**: ORANGE is a novel approach that enables general purpose DNN-oriented Neural Processing Units (NPUs) to execute 3DGS without requiring specialized acclerators. Our approach offers a cost-effective and versatile solution, adhering to the principle of Ockham’s Razor by maximizing efficiency without specialized hardware.

  ASDR: Exploiting <u>A</u>daptive <u>S</u>ampling and <u>D</u>ata <u>R</u>euse for CIM-based Instant Neural Rendering</strong>
</a>
<br>
Fangxin Liu=, **Haomin Li=**, Bowen Zhu, Zongwu Wang, Zhuoran Song, and Li Jiang
<br>
**Description**: ASDR is a CIM-based accelerator supporting efficient neural rendering. At the algorithmic level, we propose two rendering optimization schemes: (1) Dynamic sampling by online sensing of the rendering difficulty of different pixels, thus reducing access memory and computational overhead. (2) Reducing MLP overhead by decoupling and approximating the volume rendering of color and density. At the architecture level, we design an efficient ReRAM-based CIM architecture with efficient data mapping and reuse microarchitecture.

  FATE: Boosting the Performance of Hyper-Dimensional Computing Intelligence with <u>F</u>lexible Numerical <u>DA</u>ta Typ<u>E</u></strong>
</a>
<br>
**Haomin Li**, Fangxin Liu, Yichi Chen, Zongwu Wang, Shiyuan Huang, Ning Yang, Dongxu Lyu, and Li Jiang
<br>
**Description**:  FATE is an algorithm/architecture co-designed solution for brain-inspired Hyper-Dimensional Computing (HDC) deployment, which utilizes low-precision data types for less important dimensions, enabling the replacement of multiplication operations with logic calculations. To maximize resource utilization, we design a workload-aware mixed quantization scheme that offers flexible compression based on these differences in dimensional importance. The proposed quantization framework is seamlessly integrated into the existing FPGA implementations.
