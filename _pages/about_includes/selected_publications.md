**Description**: ORANGE is a novel approach that enables general purpose DNN-oriented Neural Processing Units (NPUs) to execute 3DGS without requiring specialized acclerators. Our approach offers a cost-effective and versatile solution, adhering to the principle of Ockham’s Razor by maximizing efficiency without specialized hardware.

  ASDR: Exploiting <u>A</u>daptive <u>S</u>ampling and <u>D</u>ata <u>R</u>euse for CIM-based Instant Neural Rendering</strong>

<br>
**Description**: ASDR is a CIM-based accelerator supporting efficient neural rendering. At the algorithmic level, we propose two rendering optimization schemes: (1) Dynamic sampling by online sensing of the rendering difficulty of different pixels, thus reducing access memory and computational overhead. (2) Reducing MLP overhead by decoupling and approximating the volume rendering of color and density. At the architecture level, we design an efficient ReRAM-based CIM architecture with efficient data mapping and reuse microarchitecture.
